In real life, sometimes we would like our code to be able to make decisions.
My favorite store is TARGET that I like target @ things! so I am gonna use the target and make a control flow that gives us this ability to choose among outcomes based on what else is happening in the program. See the code below!

def target():

    print "You have just entered the TARGET!"
    print "Do you take the shopping cart or the basket? 
    answer = raw_input("Type shopping cart or basket and hit 'Enter'.").lower()

    if answer == "shopping cart" or answer == "s":
    print "I love my shopping cart, go TARGET!"
    elif answer == "basket" or answer == "b":
    print "Just buy what you need and SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
else:
    print "Please choose shopping cart or basket! you did not pick anything!" 
    target()
target()
