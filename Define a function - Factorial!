# Define a function factorial
# In mathematics, the factorial of a positive integer n, denoted by n!, 
# is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

def factorial(x):
    total = 1
    while x>0:
        total *= x
        x-=1
    return total
    
print factorial(3)

# then it will appear 6, which is 3x2x1 = 6
